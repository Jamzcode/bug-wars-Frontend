          Bug wars is a <span class="high-light">Battle Royale</span> where players create a command
          script for their bug to be pitted against other bugs. In an effort to be the last species
          standing, bugs will attack one another,
          <span class="high-light"> food and each other</span>, to increase their numbers and take
          over the battleground before the turn counter expires. The species with the most specimens
          when time runs out <span class="high-light">wins!</span>

        <div class="title">BATTLEFIELD</div>
        <div class="text">
          Each <span class="high-light">BATTLEFIELD</span> is a different environment and thus
          provide your species with a unique challenge. Species scripts that work for one
          battleground will have a different result in a different environment. <br /><br />All
          battlefields are comprise of these four elements: <br /><br /><span class="high-light"
            >OPEN SPACE</span
          >
          - These spaces are unoccupied and a bug can move freely through this environment. Attack
          and Eat commands are ineffective on these squares. <br /><br /><span class="high-light"
            >BUGS -</span
          >
          Like your unique species, opponent bugs are programmed according to premade scripts
          allowing for unique behavior. Each bug’s main objective is to attack opposing bugs and
          reproduce itself to victory. <br /><br /><span class="high-light">WALLS -</span> Physical
          barriers found throughout the battle field that obstruct your bug’s movement towards food
          and other bugs. Attack, Eat and Move commands will have no effect on these spaces and will
          result in a spent turn. <br /><br /><span class="high-light">FOOD -</span> Food is also
          located throughout the battlefield and provides your bugs with the opportunity to increase
          their numbers. Executing the EAT command on a food element will spawn +1 bugs to your
          species. Bugs attacked using the ATTACK command will consequently become food and can then
          be eaten to generate more of your bug’s species.

      <div class="script-editor-container">
        <div class="title">SCRIPT EDITOR</div>
        <div class="text">
          The <span class="high-light">SCRIPT EDITOR</span> functions as a compiler for user-input
          code, converting commands into bytecode values to be interpreted by your bug species. User
          input is entered into the upper half green section of the script editor. Once ready to be
          compiled, press the <span id="generate">GENERATE</span> button to convert into bytecode.
          Scripts can be uniquely named and using the <span id="confirm">CONFIRM</span> button.
          Scripts may also be saved by pressing the <span id="save">SAVE</span> button after the
          command list has been processed. These scripts can be saved as is or later modified for
          use in future battles through the species selector.

      <div class="species-script-container">
        <div class="title">SPECIES SCRIPTS</div>
        <div class="text">
          Scripts are how you code your species’ unique behavior. Generating your species script
          will make use of the following elements: <br /><br /><span class="high-light"
            >COMMENTS</span
          >
          are lines prefixed with an omission symbol (#) and will not be converted into bytecode
          when the script is generated. Comments will not be executed by your species’ script.
          <br /><br /><span class="high-light">LABELS</span> such as EAT or ATTACK will act as
          markers for your script to jump to when executing a CONTROL STATEMENT. LABELS are made
          distinguishable using numbers, capital letters, and underscoring. <br /><br /><span
            class="high-light"
            >ACTION STATEMENTS</span
          >
          are moves executed when a bug encounters food, enemy, wall, or an open space. When the
          specific element is encountered according to your action statement, the script will jump
          to it’s respective label and execute the presented code. <br /><br /><span
            class="high-light"
            >CONTROL STATEMENTS</span
          >
          use a LABEL to determine where to go next in your species’ script and are conditionally
          executed based on their purpose and context.
